# ProjFileTools Archived

This project was an experiment for older versions of Visual Studio that we have not carried forward in the same manner.

As part of creating transparency of the state of the repo, we are archiving this repo in current state. All issues will remain unresolved with regard to this source code.

For alternative extensions that are more recent we recommend looking at [MSBuild Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutch.MSBuildEditor).

In addition, you may log feature suggestions on [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/VisualStudio) that can be upvoted by others to help us in our prioritization of different features that go into Visual Studio.

---------------------------------------

Provides Intellisense and other tooling for XML based project files such as .csproj and .vbproj files.

See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for changes and road map.

## Features

- Intellisense for NuGet package name and version
- Hover tooltips for NuGet packages
- Go To Definition (F12) for MSBuild imports
- Go To Definition (F12) for MSBuild properties

### Intellisense
Full Intellisense for NuGet package references is provided for both packages that are locally cached as well as packages defined in any feed - local and online.

### Hover tooltips
Hovering over a package reference shows details about that package.

### Go To Definition (F12) for MSBuild imports
Set the caret on any import statement and press F12, Visual Studio will automatically open the imported file.

It supports both the traditional `Import` `Project` construct
```XML
<Import Project="foo.targets" />
```
as well as the new `SDK` attribute used by .Net Core projects:
```XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
   ...
</Project>
``` 

It supports evaluation of MSBuild properties and globs.

When the import statement covers multiple files (which is typically the case with the `SDK` attribute or when using globs), it opens the a window that displays the set of files included. In that list you can:
- click on a file to open it in Visual Studio
- hover the file name and the tooltip will display the full path

### Go To Definition (F12) for MSBuild properties

Pressing F12 when caret is on the usage of a MSBuild property will open the location where that property is defined. If multiple definitions are found, it opens a window that lists all the definitions and their evaluated values.

For example:
```XML
<PropertyGroup>
    <Foo>abc</Foo>
    <Foo>def</Foo>
    <Bar>$(Foo)</Bar>
</PropertyGroup>
```
Pressing F12 on `$(Foo)` in this case will lists both places where `Foo` is defined, including the evaluated values that get set (`abc`, `def`).

Selecting an item from the list, will open the corresponding location in the editor.
